There are various reasons to why I wanted to study Software Development. Although I have no prior experience, I am  I have a few friends who work in the same industry and tell me how much they love it. They have also mentioned how it is a high paying industry that is consistently hiring.Having a three year old son, that really spiked my interested plus I have always been interested in technology. My boyfriend told me about his friend's experience with Flatiron and I was immediately intrigued and did my research. I am so excited to learn as the weeks fly by! I know it will be hard work but that it will be rewarding in the end!
